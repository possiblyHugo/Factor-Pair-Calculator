   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
   - Open a terminal in the directory containing the source code.
   - Compile the program using the following command:
     ```bash
     g++ factor_pairs.cpp -o factor_pairs
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./factor_pairs
     ```
   - You will be prompted to input the base number.

3. **View Factor Pairs:**

## Example

```bash
Please input the base number: 12
```

Output:

```less
